# nephtali-php-ext

The [Nephtali Web Framework](http://nephtaliproject.com) is a simple, flexible, fast, and security-focused web
framework for PHP developers. While fast out-of-the-box, this extension further enhances the performance of the 
framework by providing C versions of some of the functions.

Once you've compiled and installed the extension, Nephtali 3.4 (and above) will automatically incorporate the C
functions, significantly speeding Nephtali's performance.
